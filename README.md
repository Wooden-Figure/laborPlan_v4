# laborPlan_v4
This program creates a labor plan that can be randomized or has the built in capability of individually selecting each employee for each station. This program highlights several key features such as adding new employees, 
removing employees, exporting to excel, importing from excel, and many other features. One of the highlights of this program is as SOPs change in the workplace, this program has built in capabilities to allow only 
trained employees at stations they have previously been trained in. This project was specifically created for my workplace but can be used for any workplace due to the scalability of the JSON file that is easily modified. 
For getting started to this program it requires a database, therefore clicking the file titled "data_layer.py" will create the database. This can also be used if one deletes the database. Recommended using an IDE for this program for simplicity.
For running the program, run the file titled "laborPlan". The GUI will show after this. Update the JSON file with the stations that work to the choosing of a labor plan.
Remove any stations that are not needed for the specific labor plan of your needs.
