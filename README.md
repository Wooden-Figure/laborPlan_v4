# laborPlan_v4
Program that outputs a labor plan based on several stations (allows scalability for programs/ employees) and utilizes a GUI. This program has the capability to revoke employees, delete employees, and randomly
generate new labor plans. Created this program to simplify making labor changes due to absences, especially if an employee has not been trained in a station (program has a fail safe for this)
